# Credit Assignment Through Broadcasting a Global Error Vector   
### David G. Clark, L.F. Abbott, SueYeon Chung  

This repository contains code for training the models and generating the figures from our [2021 NeurIPS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04089).

### Main dependencies:  
* PyTorch
* NumPy

To implement direct feedback alignment, we use code written for the paper [Direct Feedback Alignment Scales to Modern Deep Learning Tasks and Architectures](https://github.com/lightonai/dfa-scales-to-modern-deep-learning).
